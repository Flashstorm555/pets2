    <h3>Step 1: Combat</h3>
    <p>We are going to need several ships in this guide, but for this step just about any will do! To start off, we are going to need a combat ship to gather the nessesary material we need to really <i>supercharge</i> our ship, <a href="#">Focus crystals.</a></p>
    <p>The best place to grab these <i>insert alliteration here</i> are ship wreckages from <b>resource extraction sites</b> or RES for short. Any level will do, but make sure you're not outgunned or it's a one way trip to the rebuy screen</p>

    <p><i>Ouch. Insurance bills aren't pretty.</i></p>

   <div class="step-1/2">
     <h3>Step 1.5</h3>
     <p>Also, now would be a good time to outfit your ship for exploration, or at least shed some extra weight as we will be doing a lot of FSD jumping from here on out.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="step-2">
     <h3>Step 2: Data</h3>
     <p>Next on our shopping list tour of the bubble, we have to get 9 <a href="#">Datamined wake exeptions.</a> These shouldn't be to hard to come across as all you have to do is scan a ship's wake after they jump out of a system, but can take some time if you don't know what you are doing.
       The best place to do this would be to go to a <a href="#">High population system </a> with a wake scanner.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="step-3">
     <h3>Step 3: Surface prospecting</h3>
     <p>For this step we'll need to use a tool on <b>eddb.io</b> to find some arsenic. Simply <a href="https://eddb.io/body">click this link</a>, fill in the details below and click <i>Find Bodies.</i></p>
     <img src="#" alt="eddb.io find bodies page">
     <p>Then to make things easier, click the collumn with the percentage of arsenic. This should list all planets with a high amount of what we're looking for so it should be quicker to find. Let's pick a system and Jump!</p>
     <img src="#" alt="srv-view1">
     <p><i>I found about X Arsenic in XX minuets</i></p>
     <p>Once you are on the planet, you need to drive around in your srv and shoot the rocks you find with your turret. If you're lucky a bit of arsenic should come out. Then just target it and scoop it up.</p>
   </div>

   <div class="step-4">
    <h3>Step 4:Preperation</h3>
    <p>Now comes the tedious bit, unlocking the engineer,<i>Felicity farseer</i>, we are using to upgrade our fsd. I found that the quickest way to gain rep with her is to hand in exploration data. This shouldn't be too hard if we use <a href="#">Road2Riches</a>, and should get us a bit extra cash to buy a ship too.</p>
