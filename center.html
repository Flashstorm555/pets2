    <h3>Step 1: Combat</h3>
    <p>We are going to need several ships in this guide, but for this step just about any will do! To start off, we are going to need a combat ship to gather the nessesary material we need to really <i>supercharge</i> our ship, <a href="#">Focus crystals.</a></p>
    <p>The best place to grab these <i>insert alliteration here</i> are ship wreckages from <b>resource extraction sites</b> or RES for short. Any level will do, but make sure you're not outgunned or it's a one way trip to the rebuy screen</p>

     <h3>Step 1.5</h3>
     <p>Also, now would be a good time to outfit your ship for exploration, or at least shed some extra weight as we will be doing a lot of FSD jumping from here on out.</p>

     <h3>Step 2: Data</h3>
     <p>Next on our shopping list tour of the bubble, we have to get 9 <a href="#">Datamined wake exeptions.</a> These shouldn't be to hard to come across as all you have to do is scan a ship's wake after they jump out of a system, but can take some time if you don't know what you are doing.
       The best place to do this would be to go to a <a href="#">High population system </a> with a wake </p>
